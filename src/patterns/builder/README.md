## Builder

### How I understand
If process of creating object is complex, and we need creat object step-by-step than we use this pattern. Creating some class (builder) which has methods to set the fields of object (some sample. Example: FlattHouse (Name - "FlatHouse", year - 2020, Type - Flat)) then creating the engineer class which execute step by step methods of this class and at the end return an object.
